stretch
- [] down the line add a way to see others wallpapers

known bugs
- [] right now if you click "see example" in the new wallpaper modal, but don't click
"new wallpaper", the prompt description in the bottom right will change to the new prompt
even though it doesn't describe the new wallpaper. could probably fix this but there's
some complexity to the state now and it could get confusing

launch
- [] get a domain!
    - available on a quick look:
        - tiled.ai
        - wallpapercreator.ai
        - wallpapercreator3000
        - wallpaperXP
- [] open source the repo

questions
- do you think there's enough of a instant demo with minimal thought?
- do you think that the replicate origin is obvious enough? right now I have a feeling it's too subtle
- do you think it's a bit annoying how the window loads after 2s? I'm worried if I don't
have the auto open users won't know want to do. but there could be an element of intrigue if they just load the page and have to figure out to click "new wallpaper" themselves. can't decide
